            <dt><strong><a href="https://github.com/shanepm/VodafoneIEApp" target="_blank">Mobile IRL – Android App</a> (Java) – 2017</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              This is a work-in-progress open-source alternative to the My Vodafone Ireland app.<br/>
              It communicates with the My Vodafone mobile API via the OkHttp3 and Gson libraries.<br/>
              A long-term goal is to allow a user to log in from other operators via the same app.

            <dt><strong>Home Monitoring System – Android App (Java) – 2017</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              This is a group project that is being worked on throughout the first semester of third year.<br/>
              It runs as a service and listens for voice commands constantly. These commands can perform several actions such as taking pictures with the phone’s camera, toggling strips of LED’s on an Arduino and opening a memory-based mini-game in the app.<br/>
              The app is controllable via both voice commands and a responsive menu.

            <dt><strong><a href="https://github.com/shanepm/Reverse-Phone-Lookup" target="_blank">Reverse Phone Lookup Tool</a> (Python) – 2014, 2017</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              This is a Python script that lets you input an Eircom phone number and obtain the name and address which correspond with that phone number. It matches it against a local database.<br/>
              To create it, I needed to write a separate script that scraped the entirety of Eircom’s phonebook database. This script involves JSON deserialization, HTML parsing, regular expressions and an ORM.<br/>
              It was rewritten from scratch in 2017, hence why I chose to show two years above.

            <dt><strong><a href="https://github.com/shanepm/CIT-Dentist-Project" target="_blank">CIT Dentist Management App</a> (JavaFX) – 2016 – Result: 90%</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              This is a JavaFX application that stores dentistry information in a locally hosted Apache Derby database.<br/>
              It makes use of the MVC and singleton design patterns, and lets you create, edit and delete dentists and their patients, patients’ invoices, payments and procedures and generate reports detailing them.

            <dt><strong><a href="https://github.com/shanepm/500px-Bot" target="_blank">500px Bot</a> (Python) – 2015</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              This bot essentially follows users as they post trending images on 500px, and unfollows those users if they unfollow you later or if they do not follow you back within 48 hours.<br/>
              It is intended to be ran as a daily cronjob, and makes use of the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.

              <dd>
                This is a project I made as part of my first semester Web Development Fundamentals module.<br/>
                I considered accessibility, semantics, and responsiveness while developing it.

              <dt><strong><a href="http://www.aoifesnotes.com/" target="_blank">Aoife&apos;s Notes Redesign</a> (HTML, CSS) – 2015</strong></dt>
              <dd>
                Originally, Aoife&apos;s Notes looked like
                <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141219000852/http://www.aoifesnotes.com/" target="_blank">this</a>,
                but then I re-designed it, as shown in the link above.<br/>
                Accessibility and responsiveness would need to be addressed later, as I did not address those issues at the time.

              <dt><strong>BT Young Scientist Personality Test</a> (HTML, PHP) – 2014</strong></dt>
              <dd>
                A questionnaire website (now defunct) I made for category winning BT Young Scientists in 2014.<br/>
                See <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1484433901781678/" target="_blank">Facebook page.</a><br/>
                Submitted questionnaires were sent to a Gmail address via the mail() function in PHP and then parsed manually, as I had no SQL knowledge at the time.
